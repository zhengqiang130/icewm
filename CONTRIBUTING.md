Contributing to Ice Window Manager (IceWM)
==========================================

Thank you for using [Ice Window Manager][1].  We welcome all contributions.

Bug Reports
-----------

Issues can be reported on [GitHub][2].  Please try to submit short patches or
pull requests if you can.  If you would like to perform regular maintenance
activities (e.g. if you are a maintainer of an IceWM package for a
distribution), contact me for push access.

I normally like to have the issuers of problem reports close the report once
it has been resolved.  I do not want you to think that we are being dismissive,
because I welcome all reports.

Bug reports, feedback, and suggestions pertaining to the original CVS version
can be sent to: Marko.Macek@gmx.net or icewm-user@lists.sourceforge.net

See also [BUGS][9], [TODO][7] and the sites at:

  - https://ice-wm.org/
  - https://sourceforge.net/projects/icewm/


Development
-----------

If you would like to develop against this fork, the easiest way is to obtain a
[GitHub account][10], fork the [repository][1] and perform your development.
Send me a pull request when you have something stable.  If you submit regular
pull requests that get accepted, I will just give to push access to save time.


Translations
------------

You can provide translations by patching `.po` files and issuing pull requests,
or you can use the [openSUSE weblate tool][11].  There are two XDG files,
[icewm.desktop][18] and [icewm-session.desktop][19] than may need manual
translations.  If you have difficulties using the tools, just send me the updated
`.po` file or a patch to apply.
